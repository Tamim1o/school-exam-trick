Telling the Time Lesson 1

UNIT-13
A. Listen, read, and say

Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
It’s 5 o’clock. 5 o’clock!
Time to wash and say a prayer,
Get ready for the day, show you care.
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
Look at the clock, it’s time to prepare!

Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
It’s 9 o’clock. 9 o’clock!
Grab your bag, it’s time for school,
Learning and laughter are the golden rule.
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
Look at the clock, don’t be a fool!

Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
It’s 4 o’clock. 4 o’clock!
Time to pack up and head on home,
With friends and family, you’re never alone.
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
